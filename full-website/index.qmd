## Installing Quarto

I've found the best approach to setting up Quarto is [download and run the installer from quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

If you don't have a picture-perfect Python and R setup, you can [install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Quickstart

If you'd rather just blast off instead of actually learn anything, here you go!

### Single-page site

Create a Jupyter notebook called `my-notebook.ipynb` and run either of the commands below.

```bash
# Preview the site
quarto preview my-notebook.ipynb

# Render the actual HTML page
quarto publish my-notebook.ipynb --to html --embed-resources
```

### Multi-page website

Create a `_quarto.yml` as [outlined here](websites/multi-page.qmd), then run either of the commands below.

```bash
# Preview the site
quarto preview

# Render out as files
quarto render
```
