## Publishing to GitHub Pages

While there are all sorts of automatic methods for producing websites using GitHub Pages, I prefer to the old-fashioned "let's just put it all into the `docs` folder and publish from there" approach.

First, add the `output-dir` option into your `_quarto.yml`.

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```
