## A simple approach

The simplest approach involves having an existing Jupyter notebook and running the command below. You do not have to make any changes to the original HTML, and it will create a standalone HTML file with all images, CSS, etc embedded inside.

```bash
quarto render my-notebook.ipynb --to html --embed-resources
```

## Customizing the output

A more robust approach requires adding a YAML block at the top of your notebook. This block provide options for your output HTML, and allows many degrees of customization. This approach also helps avoid using complicated `render` options.

First, add a new cell at the top of your notebook. Make it **Raw** as opposed to Markdown, Python, or R.

Second, add a YAML block surrounded by `---` that contains any [HTML options](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) you'd like to add. An example is below.

```yaml
---
title: "This title goes at the top of the page"
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    embed-resources: true
    linkcolor: red
    theme: cosmo
---
```

When added to your notebook, it should look something like the image below.

Finally, run the the `quarto render` command.

```bash
quarto render my-notebook.ipynb --to html
```
