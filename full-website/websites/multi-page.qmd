## Multi-page website

To build a multi-page website, first create a folder full of content â€“ qmd files, Jupyter notebooks, etc etc. Then add a file called `_quarto.yml` that looks like the below.

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "My Website"
  sidebar:
    style: "docked"
    contents:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - section: "Websites"
        contents:
          - text: "Basics"
            url: websites/index.qmd
          - text: "Navigation"
            url: websites/navigation.qmd
          - text: "Styling"
            url: websites/styling.qmd
      - section: "Embedding"
        contents:
          - text: "R and Python"
            url: embedding/r-and-python.qmd
          - text: "Interactive graphics with Observable"
            url: embedding/observable.qmd
```

Customize individual page using [single-page options](single-page.qmd#customizing-the-output), or add them to your `_quarto.yml` to make styles apply to all rendered pages.

To build the website, simply run the `quarto render` command in the same folder.
