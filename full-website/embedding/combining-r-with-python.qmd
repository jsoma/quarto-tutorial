If you'd like to have Python and R actually interact, you'll need to make a couple changes.

## Setup

First, you'll add `engine: knitr` to your yaml config section.

```yaml
---
title: "Combining Python and R"
engine: knitr
---
```

Second, we'll use R's `reticulate` library to connect the two languages.

```{r setup}
library(reticulate)
```

## Usage

Import the data using `pandas`...

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("temperatures.csv", parse_dates=['Date'])
df.head()
```

...and graph it using `ggplot`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(py$df,aes(Date, Anomaly, group=1)) +
    geom_line()
```
